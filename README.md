# Chatbot-E-commerce-website

Basically the purpose of a chat bot for an e-commerce website is that using convention search bar for item searching does not give satisfactory result
i.e you need to have a prior knowledge of the product or brand you need to search and if you have wrong spelling in mind or have to know 
the proper way to search on an online search engine("using perfect tokenized query") 

this chatbot will help you by giving you freedom to enter your seacrh text irrespective of your technical or language("ENGLISH") knowledge
and allow you to do syntax and grammatical mistakes.

The Apriori algorithm used will help the users by showing them recommendation of products frequently purchased by other users and also based
on the past buying history.
